Do the following after installing FPP into your project.

1) First you'll need to install the [File Watchers plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/settings-tools-file-watchers.html), if you haven't already done so.  
To install the plugin, go to the PhpStorm Settings/Preferences -> "Plugins" -> and search for "File Watchers". Check off the plugin to install it. You'll need to restart PhpStorm.

2) Now we need to create an FPP file type.  
In the PhpStorm Settings/Preferences -> "Editor" -> "File Types".  
Add a new file type, click at the "Recognized File Types" section on the "+" icon.  
Put the name to "FPP" and description to "FPP files" (or whatever you'd like).  
Add `//` as Line comment, `/*` as Block comment start and `*/` as Block comment end.  
Set the keywords to:  

```
=>
_
data
deriving
namespace
where
with
{
|
}
```

Then click on OK.  
In the "Registered Patterns" section (with FPP selected above), click on the "+" icon and add `*.fpp`, then click OK.

3) Configure the File Watcher.  
In the PhpStorm Settings/Preferences -> "Tools" -> "File Watchers".  
Click on the "+" icon and choose "<custom>" for the template.  
Put "FPP" as name.  
Select FPP as the File type.  
Select your Scope, if you don't have one, create it. Set it to `src` for example.  
Set "Programm" to `php`.  
Set this as "Arguments": `$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/prolic/fpp/bin/fpp.php $FilePath$`  
Enter an output path, such as `$Sourcepath$`
Disable the checkbox "Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher" â€“ in my experience this is really awkward.  
Select "On error" for "Show Console".  
Click OK.

Try it out! Have fun!
